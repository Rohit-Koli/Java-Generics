Generics in Java allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that
operate on parameterized types, providing type safety and code reusability.
It enables you to write generic code that can work with different data types
while ensuring type checking at compile time.

Benefits of Generics:
    Type Safety – Prevents runtime ClassCastException.
    Code Reusability – Works with different data types.
    Compile-time Checking – Errors detected at compile-time, not runtime.
    Eliminates Type Casting – No need for explicit type conversion.

A generic function (method) allows you to define a method with a type parameter,
making it work with different data types while ensuring type safety.
